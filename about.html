      The 12th of December, 1963, was the day of the declaration of independence (Uhuru), and just
      one year later a new country was born: the Republic of Kenya, Jamhuri ya Kenya, presided by
      Mzee Jomo Kenyatta. On this day this 8mm film was made in Mombasa, Kenya.
   </p><p>
      In the beginning of this film we see a lot of people come together, watching a boatshow on the
      water and a parade from the army and traditional dressed "warriors". Fighterjets from the
      Airforce of Kenya flying in formation and we asume that Mzee Jomo Kenyatta arrives by car. On
      a banner we can read the word "Harambee". This is Swahili and means "Working together for a
      common purpose". Then Mr. Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, the future president of the Repubic of Kenya, is
      passing by on the street, walking to a place to speak to the people of Kenya. We see the name
      "Cotts House" form Mitchell Cotts P and I Ltd. and the streetname Kenyatta Avenue appears. We
      have a view on the buildings from the Ottoman Bank, Woolsworth and the New Stanley Hotel and
      more streetshots from the buildings around Kenyatta Avenue and the people in the street,
      including the text "Uhuru of Kenya" Also we see a BBQ where we asume that it is Mr.Mzee Jomo
      Kenyatta, eating something together with other people.
